<h2>Kenyan Samosa</h2>

<p>Kenyan samosas are fun to make and freeze very well.</p>
 <p>Theyâ€™re so versatile, you can use whatever ground meat and vegetables you happen to have.</p> 
<p>Just make sure to make extra for snacking on later</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
        <li>1 pound ground meat (my friend used turkey, I used beef; they were both good)</li>
        <li>1/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>1 grated carrot</li>
        <li>1 cup finely chopped cabbage</li>
        <li>1/2 finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>5 cloves garlic (we love garlic, feel free to use less)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of flour and water - mixed</li>
        <li>Oil for frying  (my friend used canola, I used coconut)</li>

<h2>Steps</h2>


<ol>
    <li>Cut tortillas in half and set aside.</li>
    <li>Brown meat.</li>
    <li>Chop all vegetables and add to meat.</li>
    <li>Add salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Fold tortillas into a triangle so that they make a pocket.</li>
    <li>Use the flour and water mixture as a paste to seal the seams.</li>
    <li>Put a heaping teaspoon of meat in the pocket.</li>
    <li>Again, use the flour and water mixture to seal the top seam and fold it over. At first I used quite a bit of the flour and water but as I got more comfortable with sealing the seams I didn't need as much.</li>
    <li>After you have a few made, heat the oil to fry them.</li>
    <li>Fry them until the pastry is brown and then flip.</li>
    <li>Remove from pan when both sides are brown and put them on a plate with a towel to absorb the oil or on a rack with a platter underneath.</li>
    <li>Makes about 20</li>
